### What I'm working on

I'm a senior undergraduate student at Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU), and an incoming direct PhD student at Nanjing University (NJU).

My primary research interests are **program analysis** and **modern compiler techniques**, with a focus on how program semantics are represented, analyzed, and transformed by compilers and analysis tools.

I'm currently studying classic and modern approaches to static analysis and compiler construction, and learning through implementing small, self-contained components to better understand their design trade-offs.
